# Reverse engineering of CAD models via clustering and approximate implicitization
### Andrea Raffo, Oliver Barrowclough and Georg Muntingh

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook of the algorithm presented in [1], for extracting primitive geometry underlying point clouds, for instance originating from CAD models, parametric BÃ©zier or spline curves, by combining clustering analysis and approximate implicitization.

The proposed method can recover algebraic hypersurfaces of any degree and is automatic, in the sense that all the required parameters, such as the implicit degree of the patches and the number of clusters of the model, are inferred. The efficiency of the algorithm is determined from numerical experiments.
